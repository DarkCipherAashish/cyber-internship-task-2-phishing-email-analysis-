    <h1>Phishing Email Analysis Report</h1>

    <h2>Phishing Indicators Found</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sender Spoofing:</strong> The email is from "security@hdfcbank-support.in", a spoofed address with a non-official domain (legitimate is "hdfcbank.com") and added "-support" to deceive users.</li>
        <li><strong>Header Discrepancies:</strong> Analysis with an online header analyzer (e.g., MX Toolbox) shows the email originated from an IP (e.g., 198.51.100.10) not associated with HDFC Bank’s servers, indicating manipulation (see screenshot_headers.png).</li>
        <li><strong>Suspicious Link:</strong> The URL "https://hdfconline-login.com/verify-now" mismatches the official "hdfcbank.com" and points to a potential phishing site when hovered over.</li>
        <li><strong>Urgent/Threatening Language:</strong> Phrases like "Urgent," "suspicious login attempts," and "permanently disabled" create pressure to act hastily.</li>
        <li><strong>Suspicious Attachment:</strong> The "account_recovery.exe" file suggests a malware payload, a common tactic in real phishing attacks.</li>
        <li><strong>Spelling/Grammar Errors:</strong> The informal "Regards" and abrupt tone shift indicate unprofessional scripting typical of phishing emails.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>This email displays multiple phishing characteristics, including a spoofed sender, mismatched URL, urgent language, and a malicious attachment. These align with social engineering techniques to exploit trust and fear, key threats in email security.</p>
