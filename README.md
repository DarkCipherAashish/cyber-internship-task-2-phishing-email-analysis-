2. **Sender Verification:** Detected spoofed sender `security@hdfcbank-support.in` — mismatched with the legitimate domain.  
3. **Header Analysis:** Examined using MXToolbox; identified a foreign IP and SPF failure.  
4. **Link & Attachment Review:** Flagged a suspicious login URL and malicious `.exe` attachment.  
5. **Language Analysis:** Found urgency-driven tone (“Your account will be disabled”) indicating social engineering.  
6. **Documentation:** Compiled findings into `phishing_report.html` for submission.
